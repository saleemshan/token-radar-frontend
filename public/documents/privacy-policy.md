We may display third-party content on the Services.

We advise you to read the respective privacy policy of any such third party and use your best discretion.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You acknowledge that no data transmission over the internet is totally secure. Accordingly, we cannot warrant the security of any information which you transmit to us.

You will be solely responsible for keeping your account against any unauthorized use. While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept confidential, we cannot absolutely guarantee its security. However, we do not store any passwords as an added layer of security. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and thus we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your data. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your Personal Information or other content you transmit using the Services, and you do so at your own risk. It is important that you maintain the security and control of your account credentials.

We will retain your Information for as long as necessary to provide our Services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including those specific to financial transactions), resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.
